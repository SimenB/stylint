### 1.2.5
add .npmignore file

update some dependencies

stylint is now smarter about looking for a .stylintrc file. here is the order of importance if you want to specify a custom stylint config:

  1 using stylint programmatically and passing in config option as a parameter

  2 using stylint via command line and passing in a path to a .stylintrc via the --config flag

  3 if the first two fail, stylint will then check the cwd

  4 if that fails, stylint will walk up 2 directories looking for a .stylintrc file

  5 if THAT fails, it checks the home directory

  6 if still nothing, and no errors happened during all this, it will just use the default config


### 1.2.4
merged in a number of PRS fixing minor issues

vendor-prefixes ( as defined by nib ) no longer triggers $ prefix errors

namingConvention outputs better err msg in case the config property is using the object format

sortOrder outputs better err msg in case of custom array

numerous fixes for post 1.0 checks (semicolons: always, colons: always, leadingZero: always)

fix for line comment space edge case


#### 1.0.7
attempt to address line feed issues on windows

fix some issues with colons: always and semicolons: always [#123](https://github.com/rossPatton/stylint/issues/123) && [#124](https://github.com/rossPatton/stylint/issues/124)

add more properties and tags to the whitelist (picture, src)


#### 1.0.5
found some issues with setState (and how it affected the global duplicate check), should be fixed

also, added direct tests for setState method (before it was just being tested indirectly)

fixed issue leadingZero 'always' setting finding false positives

##### 0.9.9
make universal less greedy

minor bug fix, some valid properties coming up as non-valid: https://github.com/rossPatton/stylint/issues/100

duplicates was reporting false positives if sortOrder also on. this has been fixed in the 1.0 branch but wasn't brought over

nesting / depthlimit check was counting extra white space between properties and value. technically, that's bad practice but it should be a separate check so lets remove that from the check: https://github.com/rossPatton/stylint/issues/101
